# Spring-Auth-Skel
A Skleton for a simple spring applications with token based authentication. Configured for an easy templating solution only using one simple script. 

## How-To
simply go inside the folder and
``` 
chmod +x ./z_change_name.sh 
./z_change_name.sh
```

note that after running __z_change_name.sh__ the file will itself and __creds.sh__ . so if you wanna keep using this template
keep a copy of those files somewhere (or just u know... clone this repo)
